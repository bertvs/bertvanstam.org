<h1>Improvisation by Inspiration (2)</h1>

<p>I almost finished my musical education without becoming a real musician. I mainly learned to play the music from the past very well. Only in the last phase of my studies, with my Artistic Research and in improvisation classes with Hayo Boerema, I learned what it is to be a creative musician. And, as I mentioned in my previous post, this has changed my views on music.<span id="more-69"></span></p>
<p>The focus on the performance of the music is not only there in organ music, and not just at the conservatory. Ask for example an average violinist to improvise one note, and he will be silenced. Nowadays, classical music is more about reproducing than producing, more about competition than quest, more about the past than about the present. The music has been completely relegated to the museum.</p>
<blockquote><p>Classical musicians need to create music themselves again.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this museum, there is fierce debate about the one and only true performance. The pianist takes the credit for the composerâ€™s work. There are extensive concert reviews without a single word about the music itself. One would almost think that there is no music than the music of the past, and that &#8216;development&#8217; means becoming better in performing that music.</p>
<p>Whoever applies himself to composing or improvising will find out how misplaced and unhealthy this museum-arrogance is. Therefore, my thesis is that classical musicians need to create music themselves again. This immediately yields four benefits.</p>
<ol>
<li>He who writes himself, becomes more connected with the present. He will be triggered to consider the place of music in the current time, and the value of music of the past. This may for example result in a musical programming that is more compatible with the listener of today.</li>
<li>When creating music yourself, personal questions will also appear. What do you want to write? What is your style? What do you have to say? Questioning yourself in this way is useful and good for personal development.</li>
<li>By writing yourself, you will learn to understand the music you perform from the inside. By this, you can gain new insights in the music, and you can develop more freedom when performing: you will play better.</li>
<li>Music written by people who can play well, is more playable and exploits the possibilities of the instrument. So, the craft of composition will also benefit when performers start composing again.</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, if we integrate the practice of composition and improvisation more with the performance practice, we make classical music something for today again, we bring it back to life, and give it new hope for the future. Perhaps then the big music museum of the future might include a section &#8217;21st century&#8217;!</p>
