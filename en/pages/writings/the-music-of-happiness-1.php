<h1>The Music of Happiness (1)</h1>
<p>When do we consider something beautiful? The question is impossible, but it continues to come back again and again. In his book &#8220;The Architecture of Happiness&#8221;, Alain de Botton applies this question to architecture. I read the book with great pleasure; through this book I got a better understanding of the reasons we like buildings for. But I also believe that these insights are broader and go deeper than just buildings. Therefore, I want to reflect on beauty in music, using De Botton’s book.<span id="more-71"></span></p>
<p>The impossible question can also be applied to music: What is beautiful music? If you ask this question to one hundred people, you will get one hundred different answers. Especially from the moment when the word &#8220;taste&#8221; appears, we quickly seem to be finished talking: it is just a fact that different people simply feel attracted to different types of music. I like this, you like that, and that’s all.</p>
<p>By the way: the impossible question is set to music, and I like it:</p>

<p>When stopping talking so quickly we do not do justice to the rich world of music. No one will dare to say that all types of music have the same value; also we cannot say that there would be only one good style. It is a fact that different music is valued differently. These differences in valuation can be affected by anything, but in the end they always find their origin in the music itself. And on this we can have a conversation with each other.</p>
<p>But how can we conduct this conversation? How do we get beyond the sharing of our personal tastes without getting lost? There must be something we can hold on to. And this exists, according to De Botton. He compares &#8216;beautiful&#8217; with &#8216;good&#8217; and finds that everything that we consider beautiful, refers to values that we esteem; values such as kindness, goodness, strength, and intelligence. This means that we can discuss aesthetics — &#8220;what is beautiful?&#8221; — in the same way as the ethical debate — “what is good?”</p>
<p>Within the field of ethics, many frameworks are presented to lean upon in a conversation. One of these frameworks is virtue ethics. This framework puts positive qualities (virtues) central, and therefore this is also a great entrance for talking about beauty.</p>
<p>Like De Botton, I started from this idea of positive values of beauty, but not about beautiful buildings, but beautiful music. This soon led to two maxims.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. In all the music we like, the same characteristics are returning; these characteristics refer to values that we esteem.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>2. One has more sense of beauty than one other, and this sense of beauty can be developed.</p></blockquote>
<p>These two maxims can offer us support in the search for reasons behind beauty in music. The first rule is also developed by De Botton, and he applied it to buildings. Similarly, I would like to find the properties that make us like music. I will present the results in a next blog—let me know if you have ideas! In the meantime, I want to think about the second maxim: what does the existence of a &#8220;sense of beauty&#8221; mean? And possibly I will include another movie with music that I like.</p>
