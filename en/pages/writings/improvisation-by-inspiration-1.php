<h1>Improvisation by Inspiration (1)</h1>

<p>My view on music has changed a lot over the past year. This is mainly due to the musical research I did: the ‘Artistic Reserach’, an important part of the ‘Master of Music’ education program. My Artistic Research was on organ improvisation. In May this year I completed this research. In this post I will present the content and results of this research. How it changed my view on music is implicitly visible here, but I will come back to this in detail in the next post.<span id="more-66"></span></p>
<p>This research started when I was still a beginner in improvisation. I had trouble studying improvisation. In my Artistic Research I wanted to learn more about the possibilities and techniques for improvisation in a modern style. To achieve this, I studied other musicians. I wanted to analyze which techniques the &#8216;big&#8217; organists use while improvising, and figure out if I could apply these techniques myself.</p>
<p>To me, the value of good improvised music is that it sounds &#8216;free&#8217;. It is an interesting question how this ‘freedom’ relates to ‘imitating others’. I discovered how this relation works in the course of this research. Musical babbling from memorized ‘sounds-like’ tunes was not really satisfying. I wanted to find a style of my own.</p>
<blockquote><p>Through others, we become ourselves—Lev Vygotsky</p></blockquote>
<p>Still, you can develop your own style by listening to others, I discovered. It is then not called ‘imitation’, but ‘inspiration’. ‘Through others, we become ourselves,’ said the Russian psychologist and philosopher Lev Vygotsky, and it is not without reason that my Artistic Research report begins with this quote. In my research I actually experienced this. The difference with literal imitation is that music needs to be analyzed at a deeper level to really get the hang of it. The question is not what techniques the composer uses, but when, why, and how he puts these techniques to use.</p>
<p>The investigation began with analyzing the ‘great French improvisers&#8217;, and particularly Cochereau. When I had decomposed his tricks completely (while simultaneously failing trying to do it myself), I switched to something else: music by Shostakovich, to bring in more sharp sounds into the French melodiousness. To know how his music feels in the hands at the organ, I arranged a symphony movement. I discovered that the way Shostakovich handles scales and harmony is very useful in organ improvisation. After this, I wanted to analyze something more towards contemporary music. Because Stravinsky brought many of the ‘modern’ innovations, I investigated his music. The innovative elements (ostinatos, rhythmic cells, independent harmonies) in his ‘Sacre du Printemps’ leads to spectacular music when they are applied to organ improvisation. Finally, I had contact with the contemporary organists Guy Bovet, Willem Tanke, and John Terwal. I learned a lot about preparing improvisations, and the effective use of the features of the organ you play.</p>
<p>In the research I searched for specific improvisation techniques, and I did find a few. But the most important result of the research is that I started developing my own style, and that I learned more about how a personal musical style can be developed further.</p>
