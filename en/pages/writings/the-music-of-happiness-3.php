<h1>The Music of Happiness (3)</h1>

<p>Call it a beautiful aria, a classic one or a good song: it is all possible. It doesn’t matter whether you like classical, jazz or pop music — it appeals: &#8220;Summertime&#8221; by George Gershwin.<span id="more-79"></span></p>
<p class="video"><iframe title="Porgy &amp; Bess &quot;Summertime&quot;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O7-Qa92Rzbk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Gershwin was popular through his musical music. At the same time he knew well the greatest classical composers of his time. He looked up to them, and he wanted to learn from them. But this esteem was mutual. When Gershwin asked Maurice Ravel to teach him, Ravel said, “Why should you be a second-rate Ravel when you are a first-rate Gershwin?”</p>
<p>When Gershwin met Alban Berg, Berg let him hear his latest creation (connoisseurs: it was his Lyric Suite). Gershwin love dit, and he was reluctant to let hear some music of himself after this complex music. But Berg liked to hear Gershwin’s music; he said: “Mr. Gershwin, music is music.”</p>
<p>“Music is music” — I think it is a liberating reply. Don’t worry about genres, and do not base your music judgments on what others write. Music’s own qualities are sufficient to judge it. At least, I interpret those words in this way, assuming that Berg did not intend to throw all music in one basket without allowing to talk about differences in quality. In other words: music is music, but of course some music is more music than other music.</p>
<p>The key question then is: what makes something being ‘music’? What does ‘Summertime’ have, causing&nbsp;its wide appreciation? On which music would Berg repeat his reassuring, equalising words?&nbsp;What makes an aria beautiful, a composition to a classic, or a song good?</p>
<blockquote><p>Music: organised sound</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, there are many factors that determine how we rate the music. A large part of these are not originating in the music itself: the moment when we heard it for the first time, the meaning we give to the music, what others think about it, whether we just had a good meal, how often we have heard this music already, and so forth. This all matters. But in addition to this, there are purely musical qualities: the ‘virtues’ of music. In a previous blog, <a href="http://en.bertvanstam.org/the-music-of-happiness-1/">The Music of Happiness (1)</a>, I mentioned that these properties do exist, and that these can be identified.</p>
<p>I want to identify these virtues on the basis of a definition of music; a definition in which the context is left out. According to this strict definition, music is ‘organised sound’. This brings us to three virtues in music: repetition, timing, and harmony.</p>
<h4>A. Repetition: the fact that something returns</h4>
<p>We can recognise the fact that the sound is ‘organised’ in the first place through repetitions. In musical compositions a lot is being repeated: not only complete melodies, but also individual tones, sounds or rhythms. That’s a good thing, because otherwise we would not understand anything and we would not hear music, but only unorganised sound.</p>
<h4>B. Timing: the moment when something returns</h4>
<p>Only repetition would be boring, and not every moment is equally suitable for repetition. This works according to the principle “After a longer journey, it is nicer to come home again.” So there must be different elements (sounds, melodies, and so on) to alternate. For example, think of the nice moment of recognition when The Main Theme returns, or the feeling of being lifted when the rhythm skips one beat.</p>
<h4>C. Harmony: how it sounds</h4>
<p>After a longer journey, it is nicer to come home again, but this cannot be the only reason for leaving home. We must also make sure that the journey itself is nice or interesting. We must ensure that the sound which is being organised, sounds good. Studies reveal that the starting point for this is a most simple sound: a pure harmony (good chord) or timbre. But when a tone or chord sounds more complicated, we could learn to appreciate it. When we recognise and understand a certain tone or chord, we experience it as more pure and more pleasant. So, a pop song is appreciated more if it has a sound of its own; the same holds for the elaborate harmonies of Mahler.</p>
<p>Repetition, timing, harmony: enjoy!</p>
