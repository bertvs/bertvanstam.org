<h1>The Music of Happiness (2)</h1>


<p>&#8220;You just don&#8217;t have any sense for music&#8221; — we know it as an effective clincher in every music preference conversation. But can we never use this ‘sense’ as an argument?</p>
<p>I believe we have something more meaningful to say about it. In my previous blog I presented two maxims that arise we view beauty in music in the same way as virtues in ethics. The second maxim of these says: “One has more sense of beauty than one other, and this sense of beauty can be developed.”<span id="more-74"></span></p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<blockquote><p>The more one pleases everybody, the less one pleases profoundly.<br />
— Stendhall</p></blockquote>
<p>In the first place this means that having a sense of beauty is not the same as understanding beauty. Appreciation is not only knowledge-based. It is even possible that bad taste is defended rationally. Having substantive knowledge gives us no more right to have a voice in judging music!</p>
<p>It means something else as well: since not everyone has the same sense of beauty, it is not possible to deduct the quality of music from its &#8216;market value&#8217;.</p>
<p>An&nbsp;example: the music of Messiaen has the image of being ‘difficult’ music. However, my experience is that those who are introduced to this music, appreciate it often highly later on. Therefore, experience it and watch the video of one of his brilliant compositions!</p>
<p class="video"><iframe title="Messiaen - O Sacrum Convivium" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x0__tgrjTkc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>So I do believe that a sense of music can be developed. This means something for musicians as well as for listeners. Musicians should be aware that they partly have an educative task as well. Not as a teacher (having a sense of beauty is not the same as understanding it!), but rather as a coach who introduces unknown but valuable music.</p>
<p>This educative task does remind me of Tolstoy; he wrote “What is art?” in 1897. As well as De Botton (see my previous blog), he connected the beautiful with the good. He even viewed art as a way to convey morality, and he found that the people should be educated through art: it should be “infecting the audience with feelings of brotherly love and solidarity!” So fellow musicians, know your task…</p>
<p>Not only for musicians, but also for listeners it is important to know that a sense of beauty can be developed. As a listener you can discover that ‘to make an effort’ can yield beautiful things. Taking your time, delving into the how and why of the music — it can yield wonderful listening experiences. Making this effort does not always imply a mental effort: sometimes you just need to let go, and surrender to the music in order to be able to appreciate it. For example, think of Canto Ostinato by the Dutch composer Simeon Ten Holt. This composition now has become a very popular work from contemporary classical music.</p>
<p>The development of the sense of beauty also implies that this is something more than the personal feeling, that ‘beauty’ exists out there. I would like to discuss this ‘beauty’ and its characteristics in the next blog. De Botton mentions five virtues in buildings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Order in complexity;</li>
<li>Balance between contrasting elements;</li>
<li>Elegance that seems effortless;</li>
<li>Coherence with context;</li>
<li>Self-knowledge, as a virtue for the designer.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to present a similar list of virtues in music. If you have any ideas, let me know!</p>
