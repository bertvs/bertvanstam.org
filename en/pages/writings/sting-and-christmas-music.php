<h1>Sting and Christmas Music</h1>

<p>For years I have been enjoying Sting&#8217;s music. For example the live recording of his concert in Berlin, together with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, is something I find endlessly beautiful. <span id="more-22"></span>In that concert, he announces the song &#8216;When We Dance&#8217;, a tragic ballad about unanswered love, like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>In my humble experience, there are two kinds of love songs. The &#8216;I love you and you love me&#8217; variety, which are boring and don&#8217;t really go anywhere. And then there&#8217;s the &#8216;I love you and you love someone else,&#8217; songs, which are far more interesting. Painful, but interesting.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, &#8216;When We Dance&#8217; is absolutely both painful and as interesting. But would a song always be uninteresting if it&#8217;s not painful? Does Sting always need to sting with his music? Each time when I hear this statement, I sense that something&#8217;s wrong with it. It can&#8217;t be true.</p>
<p>Of course, the rationale is clear. Lesson number one in creative writing is: make sure that something&#8217;s wrong. It doesn&#8217;t need to be big, it could also be the itchy back tooth of the main character. There just needs to be something needling. Without a sting, there is no tension and no story. From that point of view, the thought that painful music is more interesting than purely positive music, is a logic one. But still I did not feel comfortable with this idea. I thought of all those nice love poems, for example Lord Byron&#8217;s &#8216;She Walks in Beauty&#8217;. Is that an uninteresting poem?</p>
<p>This christmas period, I was thinking about this again. Would Sting not love Christmas? Still he did record quite some music in this genre. The numerous happy songs about this newborn baby, are these all boring? Of course not!</p>

<p>And then I saw the fantastic recording of &#8216;Hark! The Herald&#8217;s Angels Sing&#8217; from St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral, which we can see above. And I thought: this is just beautiful, this is pure beauty in music. I considered this as the final proof: music doesn&#8217;t need to be painful to be beautiful.</p>
<p>I wish you all a happy as well as interesting new year!</p>
