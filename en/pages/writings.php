	<p><small>27 December 2016</small>
    <p>For years I have been enjoying Sting&#8217;s music. For example the live recording of his concert in Berlin, together with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, is something I find endlessly beautiful&#8230;</p>

    <p>Call it a beautiful aria, a classic one or a good song: it is all possible. It doesn’t matter whether you like classical, jazz or pop music — it appeals: &#8220;Summertime&#8221; by George Gershwin&#8230;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You just don&#8217;t have any sense for music&#8221; — we know it as an effective clincher in every music preference conversation. But can we never use this ‘sense’ as an argument? &#8230;</p>

	<p>When do we consider something beautiful? The question is impossible, but it continues to come back again and again. In his book &#8220;The Architecture of Happiness&#8221;, Alain de Botton applies this question to architecture. I read the book with great pleasure; through this book I got a better understanding of the reasons we like buildings for. But I also believe that these insights are broader and go deeper than just buildings. Therefore, I want to reflect on beauty in music&#8230;</p>

    <p><small>24 December 2013</small></p>
    <p>I almost finished my musical education without becoming a real musician. I mainly learned to play the music from the past very well. Only in the last phase of my studies, with my Artistic Research and in improvisation classes with Hayo Boerema, I learned what it is to be a creative musician&#8230;</p>

	<p>My view on music has changed a lot over the past year. This is mainly due to the musical research I did: the ‘Artistic Reserach’, an important part of the ‘Master of Music’ education program. My Artistic Research was on organ improvisation&#8230;</p>
